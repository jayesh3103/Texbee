# 💬 Texbee - Real-Time Chat Application

## Real-Time Chat Application for Seamless Communication 🌐💬

### 🎯 Mission
Our mission is to create a robust real-time chat application that facilitates instant communication using the MERN stack and Socket.io. This application is designed to provide a seamless and interactive messaging experience, enabling users to connect and converse in real time.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement
Communication platforms often lack real-time capabilities, leading to delayed interactions and poor user experience. With the growing demand for instant messaging, our chat application leverages Socket.io to provide real-time messaging, enabling instantaneous updates and enhanced user engagement. 📲⚡
